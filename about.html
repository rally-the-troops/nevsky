Nevsky is a board wargame about the storied clash between Latin
Teutonic and Orthodox Russian powers on the 13th-Century Baltic
frontier. It is the first volume in GMT Games’ Levy & Campaign
Series portraying medieval military operations. Players will raise
and equip their armies and then send them out to ravage or conquer
enemy territory and to defeat enemy forces in battle. Feudal obligations
and alliances will provide a panoply of lords and vassals to
serve on campaign—but only for limited periods. Players must keep
an eye on the calendar and reward lords to keep them in the field.
